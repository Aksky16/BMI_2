## What is BMI?
- Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the weight and height of a person. 
- The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.
- In this Bot the height is taken in centimetres.
- Major adult BMI classifications are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9), and obese (30 or more).
- Physical characteristics are not thoroughly taken into account.
- BMI calculations cannot distinguish muscle and fat weight.
- BMI is used differently for children.
